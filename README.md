# Tic-Tac-Toe Online
A Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Javascript, HTML and CSS.

It's only written in a really dumb way, I didn't separate the DOM editing logic from the game logic at all,
and the game logic itself is dumb, i'm checking all the possibilities instead of making a matrix to represent
the playing board.
Never make a tic-tac-toe game like this.
